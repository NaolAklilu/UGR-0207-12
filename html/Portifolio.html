                        <p>Analog clock is a device or a tool which is used to read the time of the day. It has three hands. The Shortest hand indicates the Hours, the longer hand indicates the Minutes and the longest hand indicates the Seconds. 
                            This project made a digital analog clock that resembles the physical analog clock. Analog clock is one of my projects I have done before. </p>
                        <p>This analog clock is made using a turtle module in python. It used to tell both the time, the date, month and year. It's simple to use and modify. The code of this project uses Turtle to establish a drawing context and instantiates a Turtle object in a variable called <q>drawing_pen</q>. 
                            The name drawing_pen is a giveaway that this is the object that will draw to the screen.</p>

                    <div class = "game-detail">
                        <p> 2048 is a challenging number puzzle for kids and grown ups. The game&apos;s objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. However, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers.</p> 
                        <p>According to neurologist Judy Willis, 2048 may look like a series of doubling number numbers but really it's a dopamine goldmine. And dopamine, which is a very useful neurotransmitter, is also kind of like an addictive drug the body produces naturally. It boosts both pleasure and perseverance, while decreasing stress.</p>
                        <p><span><strong>how to play:</strong></span> Use your arrow keys to move the tiles. Tiles with the same number merge into one when they touch. Add them up to reach 2048!</p>

                        <p>This online clearance system is a web-based system that will help to facilitate the. queuing system in the clearance process of the university. This online clearance system can provide an efficient handling of information that is very easy for universities to use since it is. </p>
                        <p>This system is very useful both for the student and staff since it saves a lot of time and effort,  It is very convenient to use it right from anywhere in the world where internet connection exist, it&apos;s information processing is very fast and waiting for queue can be avoided, 
                            it is inexpensive for students and school management, it is also help the school in reducing cost such as labor and Stationary, etc.
